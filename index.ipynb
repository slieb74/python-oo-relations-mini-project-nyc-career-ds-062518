    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab we are going to practice object relationships in Python with an emphasis on has-many-through relationships. We will be building out a domain model for Guests, Invites, Dinner Parties, Courses, Recipes, and Reviews. A guest will have a collection of invites, which will relate a guest to a dinner party, thus creating the has many through relationship between a user and a dinner party. Just like any good dinner party there will be more than just one thing to eat, which means that a dinner party will have a collection of courses. Since not all courses will be unique across all dinner parties, a recipe will have also have many courses. A recipe also has many reviews, which are given directly by guests, so, guests will also have many reviews as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read through the deliverables below to begin building out these six classes and to figure out additional information about their relationships. \n",
    "> **Note:** You may not be able to build out all methods until you have set up relationships between the classes, so it is normal to jump around a bit in the building process. If you are confused about how the models below relate to each other, it may help to draw this out on a whiteboard before beginning to code."
